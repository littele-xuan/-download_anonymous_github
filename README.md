 easily download files from anonymous github
 
This code is used to easily download files from anonymous github 

You just have to pay attention 

1: Set dir as the local download folder in paerser 
2: Set url to the address of the destination file in paerser 

Note: Both paths need to retain the final '/' 

Thanks: The version provided by https://github.com/kynehc/clone_anonymous_github. This code has been supplemented on this basis, mainly including 

1: You only need a local path code to automatically create a file structure that is the same as the project locally without manual operation 

2: Local download can be performed according to different folder structures
